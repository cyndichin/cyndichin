### A bit about me
- 📱 &nbsp;Working as an iOS Software Engineer @ CNBC
- 🎓 &nbsp;Attending Georgia Tech as a part-time graduate student
- 🍵 &nbsp;Making tea every morning 

Currently, I am focusing on building my skillset as a mobile developer and hope to teach one day. I geek out over snowboarding, fitness, self-help books and board games.

On the side, I am creating a challenge tracker app called Dabbles and slowly completing 100 Days of SwiftUI. To follow me on my journey, check out my [blog](http://cyndichin.github.io) or follow @matchabytes on Instagram.
